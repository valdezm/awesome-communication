### Personal Motivations
Maybe like me, you find communication a hard thing to crack(often feeling misunderstood, I, decreasingly less so these days as it has been a long personal journey, even greater to come). Do not despair, but take courage because like anything worth fighting for, this too we can overcome through practice and much effort. Let's take our Engineering approach and really refine and test that which hinders many in our field, these soft-skills. I invite you to join me in facing this challenge. Together we can obtain success, let us enter in to this great endeavor confidently, leaning on those who have come before us and journeying with they who are aside us; to be made well and understood as we are, in so much externally as internally.
